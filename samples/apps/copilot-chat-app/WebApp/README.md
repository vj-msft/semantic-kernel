## Introduction

This chat experience is a chat skill containing multiple functions that work together to construct the final prompt for each exchange.

The Copilot Chat sameple showcases how to build an enriched intelligent app, with multiple dynamic components, including command messages, user intent, and context. The chat prompt will evolve as the conversation between user and application proceeds.

## Requirements to run this app

1. Azure Open AI Service Key and working End point. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio)
2. A registered App in Azure Portal (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
   - Select Single-page application (SPA) as platform type, and the Redirect URI will be http://localhost:3000
   - Select **`Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`** as the supported account type for this sample.
   - Note the **`Application (client) ID`** from your app registration.
3. Yarn - used for installing the app's dependencies (https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Running the sample

1. Ensure the SKWebApi is running at `https://localhost:40443/`. See [SKWebApi README](../SKWebApi/README.md) for instructions.
2. Create an **[.env](.env)** file to this folder root with the following variables and fill in with your information, where
   `REACT_APP_CHAT_CLIENT_ID=` is the GUID copied from the **Application (client) ID** from your app registration in the Azure Portal and
